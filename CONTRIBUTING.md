### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-go.git
cd langgraph-go

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests
go test ./...
```

## Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

We follow the standard Go style guidelines:

- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions, types, and packages
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test error cases as well as success cases

Example test:

```go
func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    "hello",
            expected: "HELLO",
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        {
            name:    "empty input",
            input:   "",
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := MyFunction(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("MyFunction() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("MyFunction() = %v, expected %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Documentation

- Add package documentation comments
- Document exported functions, types, and methods
- Provide examples where helpful
- Update README.md if adding significant features

### Commit Messages

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
